- The best so far explanation of the PCINT: http://gammon.com.au/interrupts

Requirements:
- 8 rotary encoders, using 16 pin change interrupt pins, in pairs.
- I2C pins must remain unused (20=SDA, 21=SCL), for other project needs.

There are not enough external interrupt pins available in Arduino Mega,
with only:
- 2 (interrupt 0)
- 3 (interrupt 1)
- 18 (interrupt 5)
- 19 (interrupt 4)
- 20 (interrupt 3) (also used by I2C)
- 21 (interrupt 2) (also used by I2C)

We can use the pin change interrupt pins to get more interrupts,
although for that we need to go directly to the microcontroller.
Given the board configuration, it seems that out of the three interrupt
groups (PCIE0, PCIE1, PCIE2) only 2 contain 8 pins, so we shall use those.

Pin mapping from microcontroller to Arduino Mega

PCIE2 group (Port K) PCINT23:16 pins map to analog pins A15:A8

PCIE0 group (Port B) PCINT7:0 pins maps a bit differently:
PCINT7:4 map to digital pins 13:10
PCINT3 -> digital pin 50 (MISO)
PCINT2 -> digital pin 51 (MOSI)
PCINT1 -> digital pin 52 (SCK)
PCINT0 -> digital pin 53 (SS)

Using the pins 50-53 also means that SPI communication is not usable at the same time.
